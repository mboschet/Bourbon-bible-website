	 <h2>What we believe...</h2>
	 <p>We believe that every word of the Bible is true adn that it is our sole rule of faith and practice.</p>
	 <p>We accept the direct creation of the world and man as recorded in Genesis and reject the evolutionary theory.</p>
	 <p>We believe in the tri-unity of God, the deity and virgin birth of Jesus Christ and the person of the Holy Spirit.</p>
	 <p>We believe that Satan is real: that all men are sinners and in need of salvation...that salvation is by faith alone in the person and work of Christ; and that Christ lived a perfect life, died a subsitutionary death, rose-literally and physically, and will return again to Earth.</p>
	 <p>We believe in the primacy of the local church in God's program and that believers should be baptized by immersion, observe the Lord's Supper, and live Godly lives full of good works as evidence that they are saved.</p>
	 <p>We believe in the eternal security of the believer and in a literal heaven adn hell.</p>
	 <p>We seek to separate from apostasy and sin in all formes; but to remain evangelistic in fervor, fundamental in doctrine, and missionary in outreach.</p>
	 <p>We do not approve of the present-day Ecumenical Movement, the Charmatic Movement, nor the National and World Council of Churches.</p>
	 <p>We believe that marriage is the union of one man and one woman for life.</p>
